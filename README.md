# University-Book-Center-Simulation

Project Description -
The University bookstore is located in the STAMP Student Union building at the University of Maryland. Improving customer experience has always been a major business goal of the bookstore. Students across the University gather at STAMP during lecture breaks or after school hours, so the bookstore location is one which always remains crowded. Every year, students in large numbers rely on the bookstore for their primary education materials like textbooks and stationeries. Along with education materials the bookstore also sells Official University Merchandise and novels that are always in high demand. Students are primary customers of the bookstore and Barnes & Noble often find it difficult to ensure smooth transitions of customers through the store. Students face long queues and high service times during peak hours of the day and often visit the bookstore multiple times to fulfill their needs. During the beginning of every semester, Barnes & Noble experience an excessive demand among students and are therefore forced to hire a large number of staff members on a part-time basis. As the semester progresses, Barnes & Noble start reducing staff members on a random demand estimation of the arrival of customers.

Project Goal -
Aimed to focus on the problems mentioned above and eventually improve customer satisfaction. Our focus is primarily to reduce queue times and service times so that Barnes & Noble can determine the number of cashiers required at each checkout counters during different times throughout the day. Find bottlenecks if any and take precautionary measures to remove these bottlenecks and ensure customers can stroll through the bookstore without facing difficulties.

Project Results -
• Developed simulation model of Barnes & Noble Book Store in ARENA to identify bottlenecks, resource utilization and average queue waiting times during the peak period that processes around 1200 customers a day.
• Implemented reneging, balking and jockeying to replicate the real-life setting; used modules from basic process, advanced process, advanced transfer and statistics.
• Analyzed results in Process Analyzer (PAN) and OptQuest to recommend business solutions resulting in 21% increase in resource utilization and reduced average waiting time in queue from 6.2 to 3.9 minutes.
